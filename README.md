Checkers Game!

Clssic 8x8 chessboard, where only the darks spots are used.
it used 24 disc; 12 reds & 12 blacks.  (The color of the disc may change)  


I decide to create this game because i feel like i can have a perfect start with something not that rought & at the same time get experience of how to pseudocode, hard-code, to create & manage functions.

The concept of the game is pretty easy, i'll guees a lot of people have played this game before & it brings old times memories
So let me remind you the rules! 

Rules: 
-Blacks start first
-Move
  The pieces always move diagonally and single pieces are always limited to forward moves.
  A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.
-Capture
  To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.

  When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
  Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
  If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.
  If more than one capture is available, then the player decides if he prefers this or not.
  Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).
